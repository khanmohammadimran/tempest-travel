                <p>I want to be a Web Developer. I am very interested in creating websites and learning programming languages. This is probably the only thing that i don't get bored. My goal is to become more proficient in JavaScript and react. I am also learning the backend so that I can be a self-sufficient developer. That's why I'm working hard and I will until I reach my goal. </p>
